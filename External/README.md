External data
===

This is data that isn't edited by humans but rather is a collection of classes that fetches data and outputs to .csv and .sqlite files.

#### Difference to /Data/Polls.csv
The data will follow Polls.csv where data is available from 'external source' and add 'NA' to the CSV-files where data does not exist or can not be calculated in some fashion. Merged data will also follow this pattern.

All data is always sorted on A: `collectPeriodTo DESC` and B: `Company DESC`.

### Quality of the data
As high of a quality as one can expect from sources like Wikipedia meaning often ok but mistakes can be made by someone at some point in time.
